# Deep Dive Analysis

Perform a comprehensive codebase exploration with the following systematic approach:

## Phase 1: Architecture Overview
1. Identify the project type (web app, CLI, library, etc.)
2. Map out the directory structure and key organizational patterns
3. Identify main entry points and core modules
4. Document tech stack (languages, frameworks, build tools)

## Phase 2: Key Components
1. Locate and analyze:
   - Configuration files
   - Core business logic
   - Data models/schemas
   - API endpoints or public interfaces
   - State management
   - External integrations

## Phase 3: Patterns & Conventions
1. Identify:
   - Code organization patterns (MVC, modules, etc.)
   - Naming conventions
   - Error handling approaches
   - Testing strategies
   - Documentation practices

## Phase 4: Critical Paths
1. Trace main user flows or key operations
2. Identify performance-critical sections
3. Note any security-sensitive areas

## Deliverable
Provide a structured summary with:
- Architecture diagram (ASCII or description)
- Key files and their purposes
- Important patterns to follow
- Areas needing attention or improvement
- Quick-start guide for making changes

Use the Task tool with Explore agent for thorough investigation.
